			<h2>U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs</h2>
			<p class="benefactorlink"><a href="http://www.va.gov" target="_blank">http://www.va.gov</a></p>
			<p>The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is part of the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs (VA). As a major healthcare provider, VHA operates more than 170 medical centers and 600 clinics and contracts an additional $1B a year to outside providers for veteran healthcare. We are directly impacted by numerous internal and external factors such as government legislation and directives, the healthcare industry, the information technology industry and internal restructuring. Like many other organizations the VHA has been charged with reducing costs in a way that systematically produces clear, measurable and improved performance that translates into improved products and services. Each of these factors generates different pressures and makes the interchange of healthcare information critical. Additionally, our size and complexity create special technical issues for us.</p>
			<p>VHA believes a major part of the solution to these challenges is through participation in the Health Level Seven organization. We are pleased to be a benefactor member and consider the success of HL7 as strategically important to us. VHA intends to be an early adopter of the HL7 Version 3 model and is particularly excited over the possibilities of XML. We plan to be a major participant in the Government Projects SIG and look forward to partnering with other members as we expand our internal commercial off-the-shelf portfolio and develop additional provider relationships. A goal is to increase our involvement with the HL7 organization in the spirit of returning something for the many benefits we accrue.</p>
