# cda-core-2.1
CDA Schema and FHIR Logical model for CDA (supports the CCDA on FHIR guide, and other CDA/FHIR mapping projects)

## CDA Schema

The `schema/normative` folder contains the original published CDA Schema. This is the schema which is published with the base/core standard. This is mainly used for historical reference. See "CDA Schema Extensions" below for the latest version that includes all extensions; which most people will want to use.

### CDA Stylesheet

The CDA Stylesheet is located [here](https://github.com/HL7/cda-core-xsl). It is currently being managed by Alex Hanket for SDWG.
