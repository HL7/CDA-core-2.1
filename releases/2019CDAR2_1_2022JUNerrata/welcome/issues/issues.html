				<h2>HL7 Version 3.0 Normative Edition Known Issues</h2>
				This page is provided to communicate any issues that the Publishing Work Group is aware of that might 
				affect your use of this HL7 Normative Edition. In particular, this page provides a link (below) to the Quality 
				Assurance Review results for test run on this package of standards.<br/><br/><br/>

<!--				<li><center><h3>XML Validation of Information Model Designs in Normative Edition 2015</h3></center>
					In preparing this Normative Edition, the HL7 XML Validation engine was used to validate each of the generated information model (message type) schemas using Xerces 2.11.0 from the Apache Foundation.  Further, 
					the same tool was used to verify the degree to which the MIF representation of these same models was valid against the MIF. (Detailed results are in XML files <a href="#valRes">below</a>, and are summarized in the following parapgraphs.)<br/><br/>

					Validation of the 452 "message type" schemas based on data types R2 found just nineteen (19) errors.  Each of these was analyzed to determine the source of these errors, 
					with the following findings: <br/><br/>
					<ul><li>Six (6) of the failures arose the constraint on the Entity.determiner attribute was not correctly set in Visio.</li>
					<li>Three (3) of the failures arose because the use of the ambiguous data type DSET_ANY that is not a valid stype in the R2 schemas</li>
					<li>Three (3) schemas use the constraint GTS, which is actually legal, but not represented in the R2 schema.</li>
					<li>Three (3) schemas use the constraint 'DSET_IVL_TS' (two in PA, one in MR), which is apparewntly legal, but not represented in the R2 schema.</li>
					<li>Two (2) schemas (in PA) have choices that fail to link internal to the design</li>
					<li>Two (2) schemas where a value set type is not being correctly expressed somewhere between Visio and the schema, </li>
					</ul><br/>
<br/>
					Validation of the 43 "message type" schemas based on data types R2b found no (0) errors.
					<br/><br/>
					In addition to schema validation, the same 452 models were submitted to MIF validation.  As the generation process progresses, each model is first 
					represented in the HL7 Model Interchange Format (MIF) and the resulting MIF-instance (an xml file) is used to generate the schemas. 
					Validation against the MIF schemas detects errors such as improperly formed class names that will still create valid schemas.<br/><br/>
					Validation of the 437 model MIF representations against the MIF schemas found forty-three (43) errors, as follows:<br/><br/>
					<ul>
						<li>Twenty-two (22) models had errors arising from incorrectly constructed class names (such as the name includes punctuation such as a dot, name begins with lower case, etc.), or association names. Some but not all, of these errors also appear in the quality analysis reports.</li>
					<li>Twelve (12) models had errors arising from missing vocabulary constraints for attributes. All of these should also appear as errors in the Quality Analysis report for those models.</li>
						<li>Four (4) model had errors in applying vocabulary constrains. These should also appear as errors in the Quality Analysis report for those models.</li>
						<li>Four (4) model had incconsequential errors arising because the domain code "NU" had not been added to the eumerations recognized by the MIF schemas .</li>
						<li>One (1) model had invalid Entry Point name.</li>
					</ul><br/><br/>
				Validation of the six "core schemas", three "core MIF instances" showed no errors upon validation.<br/><br/>
				</li>
				<li><center><h4 id="valRes">Validation Results</h4></center>
				The results of the validtion runs are expressed in the following XML files that contain one element per file being validated.  If the "outcome" attribute is not "success" 
				following elements will indicate the error.  Results files available include:<br/><br/>	-->
